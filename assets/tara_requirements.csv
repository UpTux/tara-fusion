REQ-DATA-200,The Risk Analysis System shall maintain a security objective entity.,Defines the protection goals.
REQ-DATA-201,The Risk Analysis System shall ensure each security objective is composed of exactly one asset and one or more security properties (1..*).,Enforces the definition of a security objective as the protection of an asset's property.
REQ-DATA-202,The Risk Analysis System shall allow zero or more misuse cases to be optionally associated with an asset (0..*).,Provides an optional link for adversarial context to assets.
Threat and Threat Scenarios,,
ID,Requirement,Rationale
REQ-DATA-300,The Risk Analysis System shall ensure each threat entity is linked to exactly one security objective.,Ensures every threat is tied to a specific protection goal violation.
